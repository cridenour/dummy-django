# Dummy-Django
=====
Dummy is a simple PHP based toolkit, designed to make the development, testing and presentation of web prototypes less time consuming and more realistic.

I decided I wanted to see this functionality in Django so I forked it and will be slowly converting it over to template tags for use with quick Django mockup sites!

### Dummy can…
+ Insert randomly selected strings of placeholder text in various lengths and formats (e.g. headline, teaser, paragraph).
+ Automagically crop and size high quality, news worthy, Creative Commons licensed placeholder images from a default pool – or from a specific folder or subset of folders that you provide.
+ Flesh out highly variable, asset rich layouts quickly with friendly, human-readable logic for building loops and controlling probability.
+ Allow you to focus on the important things – namely, the design and the code – not on copying and pasting (static) Lorem Ipsum, or hunting down plausible placeholder images.
+ More. Not lots more, but a _bit_ more!

### Why?
Dummy is great. The lorem template tags only go so far. 

### Requirements
Python, Django, etc. 

### TODO
+ Make the conversion!
